libfive-unity
=====================

### A quick CSharp/Unity wrapper for the amazing [libfive](https://github.com/libfive/libfive).

Supports operator overloading, tons of convenience functions, Context-based automatic disposal of unmanaged resources, and a strong editor interface.

### Warning
-Only basic mesh rendering is implemented for the output; Use the unwrapped, untested functions in `libfivesharp.libFiveInternal` at your peril!

-Many of the convenience functions found in `libfive-Studio` have not been reimplemented here.

-Much of the functionality is untested!

-Only comes with precompiled binaries for Windows.

-Save often! The plugin has been known to crash Unity from time to time!
